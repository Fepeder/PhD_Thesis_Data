# Description
In the Single Month (SM) approach, the reduced time horizon S is set equal to 1, and the initial stock each SKU in month is set equal to the one used by the company. 
Model results for production shifts were used to calculate ending stock versus actual sales. 
This final stock was valued compared to the final stock obtained by the company to compare the solutions but was not used as the starting stock for the following month. 
The folders contain the instances used to solve the model both before and after the fine tuning process.
