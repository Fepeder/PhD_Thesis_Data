# Description
The tactical model is analyzed with a rolling horizon approach, with different reduced time horizons.
In the Single Month Rolling approach (RSM) the individual months were resolved by taking the initial stock, the one actually realized = company data for the month of January only.
Model results for production shifts were used to calculate ending stock versus actual sales.
This final stock was valued against the final stock obtained by the company for comparison.
It was used as the starting stock for the following month. The same thing was done for the following months.
The folders contain the instances used to solve the model both before and after the fine tuning process.
