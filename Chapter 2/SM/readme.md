# Description

In the Single Month (SM) approach, the reduced time horizon S is set equal to 1, and the initial stock each SKU in month is set equal to
the one used by the company. Model results for production shifts were used to calculate ending stock versus actual sales.
This final stock was valued compared to the final stock obtained by the company to compare the solutions but was not used as the starting stock for the following month. 
The two folders contain the instances before and after fine tuning.
