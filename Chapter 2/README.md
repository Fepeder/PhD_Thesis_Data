contain the dataset of real-world instances created by using the data of the company in year 2023.
The division is based on the two models presented which differ on the basis of the time horizon considered and the constraints used.
These data have been used to solve mathematical models both implemented in the AMPL sofware and solved on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPUW 3680@, 3.33GHz, RAM 64 GB PC by using CPLEX 20.1.0
