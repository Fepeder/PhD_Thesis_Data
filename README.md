# PhD_Thesis_Data
This repository contains the instances used in the study of optimization problems presented in my PhD thesis. 
Each instance is carefully documented and organized to facilitate replication and further research.

# Contents
- **Instances**: All the datasets and problem instances used in the thesis.
- **Documentation**: Descriptions of each instance.

# Usage
To use the instances, you can simply navigate to the instances folders. 
In each folder you can find the Instances Data and Readme file with the descriptions.
The data is divided into two main folders which reflect the two problems studied in the PhD thesis:
-  [Chapter 1](https://github.com/Fepeder/PhD_Thesis_Data/tree/main/Chapter%201): Exact and Heuristic Solutions for the Stock Allocation Problem with FIFO Picking Operations
-  [Chapter 2](https://github.com/Fepeder/PhD_Thesis_Data/tree/main/Chapter%202): An Integrated Goal Programming and Chance Constrained Optimization Approach for Production Planning with Uncertain Demand

# Terms of Use
The instances and data contained in this repository are provided for research and study purposes.
Commercial use is prohibited without prior authorization.
Please properly cite this repository and my doctoral thesis in any publications or derivative works.
