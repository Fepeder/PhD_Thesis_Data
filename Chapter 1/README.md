# Description
The folder [instances](https://github.com/Fepeder/PhD_Thesis_Data/tree/main/Chapter%201/Istances) contains a dataset of 108 real-world instances created by using the data of the company in 2022.
These data have been used to solve the mathematical model formulated and the heuristic algorithm.
Both the solutions proposed were implemented in C++ using Visual Studio the model was solved by using CPLEX 20.1.0 on an Processor Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-1290P, CPU @3.70GHz, 64 GB RAM.
